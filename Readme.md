# BrewCast ☕📊  
**Forecasting Success in the Coffee Business**

BrewCast is a predictive machine learning solution developed to assist small coffee shop owners in forecasting successful business days. By leveraging weather patterns and historical sales data, BrewCast empowers data-driven decisions for resource optimization, marketing timing, and staffing.

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

**Meet Maryam**, an aspiring coffee shop owner navigating the challenges of demand forecasting, resource planning, and staffing. BrewCast helps her predict successful sales days using a blend of environmental (weather) and temporal (time/date) factors.

With over **600 days of real-world data**, BrewCast was trained to classify business days as successful or not, helping Maryam plan proactively instead of reactively.

## 📌 Objectives

- Develop a predictive ML model to identify profitable business days.
- Provide actionable insights to optimize:
  - **Staffing**
  - **Inventory**
  - **Promotion timing**
- Enhance efficiency and profitability for small businesses.

## 🧠 Model & Methodology

### 🔢 Dataset Features
- `date`  
- `avg_temperature`  
- `humidity`  
- `rain`  
- `weekend`  
- `number_of_customers`  
- `coffee_ordered`  

> Data sources:  
> - Internal coffee shop sales (over 2 years)  
> - Weather data from NMC & Weather Underground

### 🛠 Preprocessing
- Removed holidays, Ramadan, and shop-closed days
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Aligned and merged timestamped datasets
- One-hot encoding for categorical features
- Normalization for numerical values

### 🌲 Model Selection
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- Chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and interpretability

### 📊 Evaluation
- **98.5% validation accuracy**
- Evaluated using accuracy and feature importance
- Top features: temperature, rain, weekend flag, and customer count

---

## 📈 Results

- Achieved **98%+ accuracy** on validation data
- Visualized key trees for interpretability
- Enabled **real-time predictions** for resource planning
- Suggested offer timings and staff scheduling based on forecast
